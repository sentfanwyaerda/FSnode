#FSbrowser

###How does it work?

###Why is FSbrowser included with FSnode?
It is quite simple; to test each FSnode extension, you will need to be able to establish connection, scan the directories and read a file. In the future FSbrowser will let you do even more file management tasks (to test your FSnode extension).
